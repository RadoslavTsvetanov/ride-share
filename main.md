Ride share (MAking private transport) public

# What is the problem we are trying to solve

## Public transport is ineeficient

### Routes are hard to change 

Since routes are predetermined and fixed people often need to "prekachvat". This is not a good strategy since we lose a lot of time 

### Feedback isnt taken back

Since public transport is a nation entity feedback often needs to go through a lot of steps in order to make it into action. With our platform there is a central and easy to use platofrm to submit. Since private copanies will be into the mix it will be prfit incentived which makes it so that they read their reviews
