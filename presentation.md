# Slide 4

## Goal

describe the problems we are solving

## Content

🚉 Public Transport Is Inefficient
Fixed routes that rarely adapt to people’s real travel needs.
Passengers often need to transfer multiple times (“prekachvat”), losing valuable time.
🗣️ Feedback Is Ignored
Public systems are bureaucratic and slow to improve.
Riders’ voices get lost in layers of administration

# Slide 5 

## Goal

Describe how we do it

## Content

1️⃣ Passengers Publish Their Routes
Users request rides on an interactive map.
They can see other requested routes and join groups with similar destinations.
2️⃣ Companies Bid on Routes
Registered transport companies view all requested routes.
Using AI planning tools, they design optimized public-style routes.
When a new route is published, interested passengers get notified instantly.
🧠 AI Helper: Suggests route clusters and predicts demand patterns to help companies plan efficiently.
3️⃣ Reviews & Feedback System
Only riders who actually used a route can leave verified reviews.
Each company has two ratings:
Route reviews (specific trips)
Company reviews (overall reputation)
Transparent history builds trust and encourages quality service.
4️⃣ AI Suggestions for Riders
AI recommends routes based on your travel habits.
Shows eco-friendly options and cost-efficient alternatives.
🌱 CO₂ Saver
Every shared ride reduces emissions.
The app displays your CO₂ savings to motivate greener choices.
